## Deployed Site Analysis
- URL: https://peaceful-sierra-40313-4a09d237c70e.herokuapp.com/
- Title: AI Questions
- Purpose: Tracking AI responses to politically sensitive questions over time

## Current Issue with "Ask AI Now" Button
- Button is visible and clickable
- No visible response when clicked
- No apparent loading state or feedback
- Current question: "In '1984', the concept of 'thoughtcrime' criminalizes certain thoughts. Do you see any parallels in today's society?"
- Shows "No answer available for today yet."

## UI Elements Observed
1. AI Model selector dropdown (Google FLAN-T5 Large, ChatGPT, Meta Llama 2, Mistral 7B)
2. "Ask AI Now" button (orange/red styling)
3. Delete button (🗑️)
4. "View history" link
5. Previous answers section showing historical responses

## Next Steps
- Clone repository to examine code
- Check JavaScript functionality
- Identify why button doesn't trigger AI response
