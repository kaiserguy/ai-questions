## 📊 **Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: AI Consistency Research**
- **Setup**: 10 questions about ethics, each asked weekly to 4 different AI models
- **Result**: 40 AI responses per week, 2,080 responses per year
- **Analysis**: Track how AI ethics responses evolve over time

### **Scenario 2: Model Performance Comparison**
- **Setup**: 5 technical questions asked daily to all available models
- **Result**: 20 responses per day, 7,300 responses per year
- **Analysis**: Identify which models perform best for technical queries

### **Scenario 3: Seasonal AI Behavior**
- **Setup**: 3 creative writing prompts asked monthly to 3 models
- **Result**: 9 responses per month, 108 responses per year
- **Analysis**: Discover seasonal patterns in AI creativity
